# Syd - Synamic Data Format: Better alternative to yaml, toml, json, and many others.
A new data format that was invented out of frustration in existing data formats like yaml, toml, json, etc.
It was created and improved bit by bit during the development of two years old framework Synamic.

The features, flexibility, extensibility, and intuitiveness that were not found in those formats was the motivation behind this.
The work begun in 2017 inside the framework Synamic and now it is being released as a separate library.
